-- | Validators shouldn't know more about the schema they're going to
-- be used with than necessary. If a validator throws errors using the
-- error sum type of a particular schema, then it can't be used with
-- other schemas later that have different error sum types (at least not
-- without writing partial functions).
--
-- Thus validators that can only fail in one way return 'FailureInfo's.
-- Validators that can fail in multiple ways return 'ValidationFailure's
-- along with an custom error sum type for that particular validator.
--
-- It's the job of a schema's validate function to unify the errors produced
-- by the validators it uses into a single error sum type for that schema.
-- The schema's validate function will return a 'ValidationFailure' with
-- that sum type as its type argument.
